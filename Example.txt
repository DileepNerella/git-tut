there are four areas a developer need to be aware of when working with 
git

2.staging area.
3.local repo.
4.remote repo.

git push command is used for moving files from 
local to remote.
git commit is used to push files from staging area to local repo.

but dont want to push them yet.

individual files can be added to staging area but not for the 
local repo.
